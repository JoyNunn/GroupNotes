This is a mirror of the group notes project for the RTT 38 cohort of the AWS/Restart class at Per Scholas. 
For access to the original document, you must be an RTT 38 cohort. Contact Gabriel via Slack for access.
This mirror is updated at least every week. You are free to fork this project as a basis for your own personal notes.
