This is a mirror of the group notes project for the RTT 38 cohort of the AWS/Restart class at Per Scholas. Use this if Google Docs is too cumbersome for your computer or internet connection. <br><br>
Access the notes as a webpage at: https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/JoyNunn/GroupNotes/blob/master/AWSReStartLectureNotes.html<br><br>
The HTML tab uses about 300MB less memory than having Google Docs open.<br><br>
For access to the original document, you must be a student with the RTT 38 cohort. Contact Gabriel via Slack for access. <br><br>
All are welcome to share group notes, and everyone is highly encouraged to participate in adding to them. 
<br><br>
This mirror is automatically updated at 5 PM every day. You are free to fork this project as a basis for your own personal notes or copy as you see fit.
